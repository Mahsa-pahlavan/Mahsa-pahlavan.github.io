Hello! I'm currently an MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at Amirkabir University of Technology. My academic journey revolves around delving into the fascinating realm of AI and its applications. Alongside my studies, I'm actively engaged as a research assistant in the Statistical Data Analysis Laboratory, under the expert guidance of Dr. AnirMazlaghani. I'm particularly intrigued by the challenge of enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural networks, a pursuit that fuels my curiosity and ambition. Moreover, I'm fervently exploring opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge research as I actively seek out Ph.D. positions to continue my academic journey.
