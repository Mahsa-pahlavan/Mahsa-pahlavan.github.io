    - title: Adversarial Robustness
      items:
        - I am particularly intrigued by the exploration of why adversarial examples exist and whether a similar phenomenon occurs in the human brain. My research delves into not only enhancing various adversarial training methods but also uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena.

    - title: Computational Neuroscience
      items:
        - My interests lie in the convergence of human vision and its comparison to deep learning methods for computer vision.
        - I am also driven by the goal of designing learning algorithms for deep learning models that emulate the brain's behavior and learning patterns.
